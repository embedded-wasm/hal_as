# WASM Embedded AssemblyScript HAL

An [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html) HAL based on the embedded-wasm [spec](https://github.com/embedded-wasm/spec).

## Status

WIP, Extremely Alpha. Implemented interfaces should work, but, expect changes and breakages as we develop the ecosystem.
